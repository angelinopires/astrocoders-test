# Astrocoders Test 

This is a test of Astrocoders. I was challenge to build a sort of a Gmail application, that receive some Tweets from Twitter, with a specific hashtag.

## Stack and Tools used:

- NPM v6.4 / Node v10.6.0
- React v15.6.2 / Ramda v0.26

## Setup

While I'm developing this test, I'm using two servers. One backe-end Client to make the requisition to Twitter's API; And the another to develop on Front-end (Webpack Server). 

- To run the back-end Server: `` cd Server; npm install; npm start ``

- To run the front-end Server: `` cd Client; npm install; npm start``

### Still working
